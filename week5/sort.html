		<h3>Design</h3>
		<article>
			<p>
				I performed four sorts with content from the Iosco-Arenac District Library Site. I didn't want to add or delete any of the site's original content before seeing what people thought of it. (In my sort I chose to eliminate a few of the cards while adding a few new ones.)
				<br/><br/>
				There were 58 cards.

				<p>
					The sorts that my participants did revealed some interesting things about how they think about content.
					<ul>
						<li>When it comes to organizing the branches of the library, what I think is one of the main things people will use the sight for, my participants all organized it slightly differently.<br/><br/>
						Two of the cards listed the county names (Iosco and Arenac). I intended them to represent links to the county government sites. Due to the ambiguity, one of my participants organized the branches by their repsective county. Three of the branches are in Arenac County and the other five are in Iosco County. He lives in Arenac County and said that the branches are fairly far away from one another. Anybody visiting the site would likely be looking at libraries from one county or the other and not both.
						<br/><br/>
						In two of the organizations, the branches were all kept together under a "branches" category. This is how I sorted the cards because it seems to be consistent with other library sites. Organizing them by county, though, might make more sense in this situation.
						<br/><br>
						The last participant sorted the branches separately. So, all Tawas Library information was kept together, but separate from the Whittemore library information, for example. This sort emphasizes individual libraries in the way that the Grand Rapids Public Library site does.
						<br/></li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>One of my particpants thought content like "annual reports", "technology plan", and "personell manual" is relatively unimportant and can be kept in a footer.
						<br/><br/>
						Other sorts kept this information in a group with information about the library's board of directors.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>In my sort, I organized some of the information into a "quick links" section. I've seen a lot of these on library sites. Some of the other sorts placed these cards ("catalogue", "access your account", "public use computers FAQ") in a header or in an "about" section.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>There really weren't any innovative ways of grouping the programs and events. All of the sorts grouped the event cards in a single event section. One sort did put repeated events in a "reoccuring events" group.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>There are a variety of electronic resources/external links. Some were grouped separately for kids, but on the whole no sort was able to distinguish much between links to databases and other resources. Part of the problem may be that some of the links don't really need to be on the site , familydoctor.org or the weather channel, for example. All of these resources are on the current site's "Answer Desk" pages. The site describes them as "helpful links". I think I will have to look to other library sites to develop a more sophisticated organization of these resources. 
					</ul>
