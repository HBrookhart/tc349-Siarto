		<p> I propose to re-design the website for the Iosco-Arenac District Library. Regardless of which branch (there are eight) they frequent, patrons have to navigate a single site for information pertaining to their local library and the district overall. This district consists of fairly small communities, but their devotion to public libraries is evident from the number of libraries and the conctent on their website.<br/><br/>
		Unfortunately, the site is not well designed. Libraries, especially small ones tend to lack funding for web design. It's up the employees to put something together based on their existing knowledge. So, it's no surprise that the site is not top notch design wise. It could be better, though, and I have some ideas.

		<h3>Issues:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>crowded and bulky homepage</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.ioscoarenaclibrary.org/locations.html" target="_blank">locations and hours content</a></li>
			<li>style via tables</li>
			<li>juvenile asthetic</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.ioscoarenaclibrary.org/Events.html" target="_blank">programs and events content</a></li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<h3>Inspiration</h3>
		<p>
			There are some really nice looking library sites out there. Here are a couple that have given me ideas on the redesign.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			<div section id="inspiration">
				<a href="http://www.grpl.org/" target="_blank"> Grand Rapids Public Library</a>
				<ul>
					<li>Every pages on the site has a fat footer with the branch locations and hours. Plus, they are linked to an individual branch page.</li>
				</ul>
				<a href="http://tscpl.org/" target="_blank">Topeka & Shawnee County Public Library</a>
				<ul>
					<li>I'm looking for a better way to display events. I would like to make some sort of calendar in place of the list that's currently on the site. The calender application on this site is intriguing.</li>
					<li><div id="TSCPL"><img src="calender50.jpg" alt="TSCPL Events"/></li>
				</ul>
				<a href"http://oppl.org/" target="_blank">Oak Park Public Library</a>
				<ul>
				<li>This site isn't overwhelming color-wise. I like the way the contents are in blocks without it looking like the table (from Iosco-Arenac District's site). The top navigation looks sharp and the drop down menus.</li>
				<li><div id="OPPL"><img src="topnav.jpg" alt="OPPL Navigation"/></li>	
				</ul>
			</div>
